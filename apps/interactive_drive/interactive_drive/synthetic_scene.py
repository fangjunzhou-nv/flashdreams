"""Runtime helpers for booting interactive-drive without HD-map content.

Produces a fully procedural USDZ with the same on-disk layout the scene
loader expects (synthetic trajectory + lane lines + intersection geometry +
a caller-supplied initial RGB), so the world-model runtime runs unchanged and
unaware the scene is procedural. Thin wrapper around
``scene_fixture.build_synthetic_scene_usdz`` that adds an ``--initial-rgb``
path so demos can seed a real driving photo instead of the test gradient.
