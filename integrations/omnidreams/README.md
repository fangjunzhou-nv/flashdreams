# `omnidreams`

Omnidreams integration package for `flashdreams`.

## Hugging Face assets

Omnidreams resolves public Omni Dreams assets from the `nvidia` Hugging Face
org:

- `nvidia/omni-dreams-models` for checkpoints.
- `nvidia/omni-dreams-samples` for bundled example data.
- `nvidia/omni-dreams-scenes` for WebRTC scenes.

Set `HF_TOKEN` to a token with access to these repos before running or
importing FlashDreams:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=<YOUR-HF-TOKEN>
```

## Run batch evaluation

The `omnidreams-eval` CLI automates a fixed-split evaluation flow for
OmniDreams scene batches:

1. Discover Hugging Face scene assets and write a JSONL manifest.
2. Plan byte- or count-capped batches.
3. Stage one batch into local scratch storage.
4. Run FlashDreams generation for the staged cases.
5. Validate generated artifacts and runner logs.
6. Stage/run DrivingGen FVD-lite and WorldLens consistency evaluators.
7. Write a JSON and Markdown summary report.
8. Optionally compare the summary against a checked-in metric baseline.

The high-level workflow is:

```bash
RUN=/trees/$USER/od-runs/od-26.01
SCRATCH=/local_nvme/$USER/omnidreams-eval-scratch
BASELINE=integrations/omnidreams/eval_baselines/od-26.01-worldlens-40-v1.json

uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams omnidreams-eval discover \
  --output "$RUN/manifest.jsonl"

uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams omnidreams-eval plan-batches \
  --manifest "$RUN/manifest.jsonl" \
  --output "$RUN/batches.json" \
  --batch-size 20

uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams omnidreams-eval stage-batch \
  --manifest "$RUN/manifest.jsonl" \
  --batch-plan "$RUN/batches.json" \
  --batch-id batch-00000 \
  --scratch-root "$SCRATCH" \
  --output "$RUN/staged/batch-00000.jsonl"

uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams omnidreams-eval generate \
  --staged-manifest "$RUN/staged/batch-00000.jsonl" \
  --run-root "$RUN"

uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams omnidreams-eval validate-generation \
  --run-root "$RUN" \
  --output "$RUN/validation.json"

uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams omnidreams-eval summarize-run \
  --run-root "$RUN"

uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams omnidreams-eval check-baseline \
  --summary "$RUN/evaluation-summary.json" \
  --baseline "$BASELINE" \
  --output-json "$RUN/baseline-check.json"
```

External evaluator setup is intentionally separate from FlashDreams generation,
because DrivingGen and WorldLens have their own dependencies and checkpoint
caches. Use `setup-evaluator` for DrivingGen and `setup-worldlens` for
WorldLens, then run the corresponding `prepare-*` and evaluator commands. The
adapter modules pin the upstream GitHub URLs and revisions used today; moving
those pins into shared config or a maintained fork is a reasonable follow-up if
the evaluator stack becomes long-lived.

Runtime depends mostly on FlashDreams generation and evaluator environment
setup. On a workstation-class GPU such as an RTX 6000 Pro, 20-scene batches are
intended to be practical, while the full Hugging Face scene set should be run in
batches to avoid staging all 1-2 GB scenes at once. Evaluator setup can also
download model checkpoints and may take several minutes on first use.

Interpret the report as follows:

- Validation checks generation completeness, frame counts, runner schedules,
  and missing artifacts. Any validation failure should be inspected before
  trusting evaluator metrics.
- DrivingGen FVD-lite is a regression metric. Lower is better only when
  comparing the same fixed scene split across model versions. Do not compare
  `batch-00000` directly against `batch-00001` as a quality claim.
- DrivingGen reference-vs-reference FVD is diagnostic only; it measures split
  diversity, not OmniDreams quality.
- WorldLens temporal and subject consistency are roughly higher-is-better, with
  1.0 as an idealized upper bound. They are useful standalone video-consistency
  signals, but they do not directly measure closed-loop simulator quality,
  path correctness, off-road behavior, or collisions.
- `check-baseline` compares a run summary against a JSON file containing the
  accepted metric envelope. Keep generated clips as run artifacts, not in the
  baseline JSON; the baseline should contain only expected metric values and
  tolerances.

## Run the local-window desktop demo

The `local-window` mode launches the single-process driving demo. Refer to the
[interactive guide](omnidreams/interactive_drive/README.md) for controls and
runtime requirements.

```

## Native DiT defaults

NVIDIA OmniDreams native DiT acceleration remains gated by the pipeline config's
`native_dit_acceleration` policy (`disabled`, `auto`, or `required`). When that
native path is enabled, the default compute profile is the FP8 KV-cache backend
with cuDNN attention:

- `native_dit_backend="fp8_kvcache_cudnn"`
- `native_dit_attention_backend="auto"` (currently resolves to cuDNN)

Set `native_dit_attention_backend="sparge"`, `"sage3"`, or `"sage3_fp8"`
explicitly to opt into Sparge/SageAttention-3 experiments. Use
`native_dit_sparge_hybrid_period > 1` with `"sparge"` to enable the FP8
Sparge/SageAttention-3 hybrid schedule when the extension and GPU support it.

The native extension explicitly targets `12.0a` on validated compute capability
12.0 GPUs that support the architecture-specific SageAttention-3 FP4 path. On
other GPUs, including GB300, it leaves architecture selection to PyTorch and
builds SageAttention-3 stubs so its SM120a-only FP4 instructions are excluded.
Set `OMNIDREAMS_SINGLEVIEW_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` to override this behavior, or set
`TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` to use PyTorch's standard override (which takes
precedence). Explicit `12.0a` and PyTorch-default builds use separate extension
caches so an incompatible kernel image is not reused between them.

## Run tests

Run tests from the workspace root. Sync the OmniDreams `dev` extra, which
provides the interactive-drive test dependencies, together with the workspace
`test` group, which provides pytest and its shared plugins:

```bash
uv sync --package flashdreams-omnidreams --extra dev --group test
```

Run all tests that participate in CPU or GPU CI with:

```bash
uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams --extra dev --group test pytest \
  integrations/omnidreams/tests \
  -m "not manual" -v
```

Use the tier markers to run a narrower suite:

```bash
# CPU-safe tests
uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams --extra dev --group test pytest \
  integrations/omnidreams/tests -m ci_cpu -v

# Tests that require CUDA, libGL, or cv2
uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams --extra dev --group test pytest \
  integrations/omnidreams/tests -m ci_gpu -v
```

Heavy, credential-dependent, or environment-specific tests use the `manual`
marker. For example, run the end-to-end streaming pipeline test on a suitable
GPU with access to the required checkpoints:

```bash
uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams --extra dev --group test pytest \
  integrations/omnidreams/tests/test_omnidreams_pipeline.py::test_omnidreams_streaming_inference \
  -p no:manual_marker -m manual -v -s
```

The native CUDA extension build smoke test is opt-in because it performs a
clean extension build:

```bash
OMNIDREAMS_SINGLEVIEW_RUN_NATIVE_BUILD_TEST=1 \
uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams --extra dev --group test pytest \
  integrations/omnidreams/tests/test_omnidreams_singleview_native.py::test_cuda_native_extension_builds \
  -m ci_gpu -v -s
```

Keep `--extra dev --group test` on `uv run`: it synchronizes the shared `.venv`
before launching pytest, and omitted selections may be removed.

## Run benchmarks

The OmniDreams benchmarks are manual, GPU-only pytest tests. Run them from the
workspace root on a supported NVIDIA GPU. First sync the OmniDreams package and
the workspace `test` dependency group, which provides both `pytest` and
`pytest-benchmark`:

```bash
uv sync --package flashdreams-omnidreams --group test
```

Run the complete benchmark suite with:

```bash
uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams --group test pytest \
  integrations/omnidreams/benchmarks \
  -p no:manual_marker -m manual --benchmark-only -v
```

To run a narrower benchmark, replace the benchmark directory in that command
with one of these files:

- `test_modules.py` benchmarks the DiT block, self-attention, and
  cross-attention with the `omnidreams_torch` and `triton`
  implementations. The backend-independent MLP is benchmarked once.
- `test_network.py` benchmarks one steady-state DiT evaluation with the
  `omnidreams_torch`, `triton`, and native `cuda`
  implementations. It uses production tensor geometry with random weights, so
  checkpoint loading and startup are excluded.
- `test_pipeline.py` benchmarks steady-state generation and finalization with
  the `omnidreams_torch`, `triton`, and native `cuda`
  implementations at the runner's production 704x1280 resolution and scheduler
  configuration.

The Triton implementation uses row-scaled FP8 projections and an E4M3 cache
for self-attention; text and cross-view attention remain BF16.

The Triton cases require an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 9.0 or newer;
they skip cleanly on older GPUs.

Keep `--group test` on both commands. A plain
`uv sync --project integrations/omnidreams` installs only the integration's
runtime dependencies, so a later `uv run pytest` cannot find the benchmark
test tools. The benchmarks manage their warmup and measured rounds internally;
when publishing results, also record the commit, GPU and software stack, model
configuration, and any fallback warnings.

## Run WebRTC server
## Run (shared demo API)

From the repository root on a CUDA machine:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=<your-hf-token>

mkdir -p outputs
uv sync --python 3.12 --package flashdreams-omnidreams --no-dev
```

Run the precomputed-HDMap replay path without writing video:

```bash
uv run --python 3.12 --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
  omnidreams null \
  --device cuda:0 \
  --scenario.example-data true \
  --scenario.example-data-uuid 239560dc-33d1-11ef-9720-00044bcbccac \
  --scenario.total-blocks 10
```

Generate an MP4 from the bundled precomputed-HDMap example assets:

```bash
uv run --python 3.12 --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
  omnidreams mp4 \
  --device cuda:0 \
  --scenario.example-data true \
  --scenario.example-data-uuid 239560dc-33d1-11ef-9720-00044bcbccac \
  --scenario.total-blocks 10 \
  --output.fps 30 \
  --output.path outputs/omnidreams-precomputed.mp4
```

Generate an MP4 from a Ludus scene and recorded keyboard trace:

```bash
uv run --python 3.12 --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
  omnidreams mp4 \
  --device cuda:0 \
  --scenario.conditioning-mode ludus-scene-driving \
  --scenario.keyboard-trace \
  integrations/omnidreams/omnidreams/demo/traces/ludus_forward_sweep_60s.json \
  --scenario.scene-uuid 0d404ff7-2b66-498c-b047-1ed8cded60d4 \
  --scenario.total-blocks 10 \
  --output.fps 30 \
  --output.path outputs/omnidreams-ludus.mp4
```

Serve the shared WebRTC demo:

```bash
uv run --python 3.12 --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
  omnidreams webrtc \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8089 \
  --device cuda:0 \
  --scenario.scene-uuid 0d404ff7-2b66-498c-b047-1ed8cded60d4 \
  --output.video-height 704 \
  --output.video-width 1280
```

Then open:

- [http://localhost:8089/request_session](http://localhost:8089/request_session)
- [http://localhost:8089/healthz](http://localhost:8089/healthz)

When `--scenario.scene-dir` is omitted, the server downloads the selected scene
from the configured Hugging Face org, extracts its
`clipgt-<uuid>[-<variant>].usdz` archive, and stages it under
`FLASHDREAMS_CACHE_DIR` (or `~/.cache/flashdreams`). If `--scenario.scene-uuid`
is omitted too, the server uses the default WebRTC scene. Weather variants ship
as sibling archives; pass `--scenario.scene-variant rain` (or `snow`) to serve
one (default is the clear-weather scene). The runtime seeds from the scene's
first ground-truth camera frame (`clipgt/frames/<camera>/<ts>.jpeg`, falling
back to `clipgt/first_image.*`) and the weather-matched `clipgt/prompt<N>.txt`
(falling back to `clipgt/prompt.txt`). Set `--scenario.scene-dir PATH` or
`scenario.scene_dir` in a launch manifest to use a pre-staged local scene
instead.

The manifest-based form remains supported:

```bash
uv run --python 3.12 --package flashdreams-omnidreams flashdreams-run \
  omnidreams webrtc \
  --manifest configs/launch_manifest/omnidreams_webrtc.yaml
```

To enable video post-processing by default, override the runner's registered
post-process preset in the launch manifest. RTX postprocess presets require the
optional NVIDIA VFX runtime:

```bash
uv sync --package flashdreams-omnidreams --extra rtx-postprocess
```

The request-session page only offers a **Post-process** selector when the server
was launched with `--postprocess-preset`; the selector can toggle that launched
preset off for the next connection.

## Run gRPC server

From the workspace root, run:

```bash
uv run --package flashdreams-omnidreams torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 -m omnidreams.grpc.server --pipeline_config_name omnidreams-sv-2steps-chunk2-loc6-lightvae-lighttae-perf --host 0.0.0.0 --port 50051
```

The server implements `omnidreams.grpc.protos.video_model.WorldModelService`
and listens on `0.0.0.0:50051` by default. Clients provide the static map,
camera specs, initial frames, prompt, rig trajectory, and dynamic actor state
through the gRPC API. Use `--record_dir <dir>` to save replayable session logs,
and add `--enable_profiling --profile_output <path>` when collecting timing
data. For distributed/context-parallel launches, increase `--nproc_per_node`;
the world size must be compatible with the selected pipeline config's camera
count.
