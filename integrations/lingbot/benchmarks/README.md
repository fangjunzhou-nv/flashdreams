# LingBot benchmarks

The LingBot benchmarks are manual, GPU-only pytest tests. The complete suite can
run on one sufficiently large GPU or with four-way context parallelism. The
single-GPU path is validated on a 256 GB NVIDIA GB300; smaller devices may run
out of memory during compile/autotune or cache setup. In the distributed path,
the 14B network has about 34.5 GiB of BF16 weights per rank before its KV cache,
activations, and compiler workspaces. The full-pipeline cases also require the
Hugging Face access and cache space documented in
[`integrations/lingbot/README.md`](../README.md).

Each benchmark layer compares the default WAN/cuDNN self-attention with the
Triton FP8 backend. Triton requires compute capability 9.0 or newer and runs
only on a single GPU because it does not support context parallelism;
cross-attention remains cuDNN in both cases.

First sync the LingBot package and the workspace `test` dependency group,
which provides both `pytest` and `pytest-benchmark`:

```bash
uv sync --package flashdreams-lingbot --group test
```

Run the complete suite on one high-memory GPU:

```bash
uv run --package flashdreams-lingbot --group test pytest \
  integrations/lingbot/benchmarks \
  -p no:manual_marker -m manual --benchmark-only -v
```

Alternatively, run with four-way context parallelism when four usable CUDA
ordinals are visible in the same process namespace:

```bash
uv run --package flashdreams-lingbot --group test \
  torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 --no-python pytest \
  integrations/lingbot/benchmarks \
  -p no:manual_marker -m manual --benchmark-only -v
```

All four workers execute every WAN test because the DiT uses context-parallel
collectives. The tests align workers before every sample. Triton cases skip in
this distributed mode because that backend is single-GPU only. Once the command
is known to work, add `--local-ranks-filter=0` before `--no-python` to show
only rank 0's report; omit it while debugging because it also hides tracebacks
from failing nonzero ranks. If `torchrun` reports `invalid device ordinal`,
reduce `--nproc_per_node` or scope `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to GPUs that are
usable together. Do not point multiple workers at one shared
`--benchmark-json` path; use a rank-specific path when retaining every rank's
raw report.

The block microbenchmark also fits on one large GPU:

```bash
uv run --package flashdreams-lingbot --group test pytest \
  integrations/lingbot/benchmarks/test_modules.py \
  -p no:manual_marker -m manual --benchmark-only -v
```

To select another benchmark layer, use one of these files:

- `test_modules.py` benchmarks only LingBot's integration-owned
  `CamCtrlBlock`. It deliberately does not add standalone benchmarks for the
  inherited Wan attention, MLP, normalization, encoder, or decoder modules.
  The whole-block timing necessarily includes the inherited Wan branches that
  the LingBot subclass executes.
- `test_network.py` benchmarks one steady-state evaluation of the complete
  random-initialized LingBot 14B camera-control DiT. It uses the CLI replay's
  352x640 geometry, compiled WAN or Triton self-attention, CUDA graph replay,
  and the shipped window15/sink3 cache layout; startup is excluded.
- `test_pipeline.py` separately benchmarks steady-state `generate` and
  `finalize` for
  `lingbot-world-v2-14b-causal-fast-taehv-window15-sink3` at the CLI replay's
  352x640 geometry. This is an end-to-end measurement, so the recurring path
  includes its configured recipe components, but metadata identifies those
  stages and no reused component is presented as a LingBot module
  microbenchmark. At the measured AR indices, the Wan I2V VAE branch reuses
  its cached latent. Reported output FPS is generate-only; use the separate
  finalize result when evaluating the complete per-chunk lifecycle.

Keep `--group test` on both setup and run commands. A package-only environment
does not include the benchmark plugin. The benchmarks exclude setup, cache
fill, compile/autotune, and CUDA graph capture from measured rounds. When
publishing results, also record the exact command and commit, GPU/driver and
software stack, checkpoint identifiers, compiler-cache state, and fallback
warnings.
