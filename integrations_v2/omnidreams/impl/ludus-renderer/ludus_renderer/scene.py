Scene loading utilities for ludus_renderer.

Use load_scene() from clipgt.py to load ClipGT or AV2 scenes. It provides
a ClipgtGpuScene with:
- timestamped_scene: TimestampedScene ready for GPU upload
- cameras: List of FThetaCamera intrinsics
- ego_track: EgoTrackData for pose computation

Example:
    from ludus_renderer import load_scene

    scene = load_scene("/path/to/scene", device="cuda")
    renderer.upload_scene(scene.timestamped_scene)
